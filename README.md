Type 'npm i' to install required packages.
routes folder contains two routes
/getData - This route converts csv to json and inserts the data into database and also displays the resultant data in tabular format
 readData - This route just displays the already present data in the database in the tabular format

sqlConnection.js is used for connection node to database


Assumptions made:
There will be no empty data in the csv
CSV file used for testing is of 30000 records

P.S
Thank you for considering me for this round ðŸ˜ƒ
